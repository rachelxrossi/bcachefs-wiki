Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I have to reformat my bcache drive to use the new bcachefs ?

To use the caching device (cdev) with the new bcachefs, you will need to
reformat it. In principle this should not be a problem, as they can be removed
from a backing device (bdev/bcache).

If you wish to reuse the backing device (bdev/bcache), you can't this is
nolonger an option.

If you wish to use bcachefs as a filesystem you will have to format the
backing device (bdev/bcache) with the new filesystem.

## Does bcachefs still have the bcache caching functionality of block devices ?

No.

## Where do I obtain statically linked bcachefs-tool (for use in initramfs) ?

You can either compile them yourself from source, or refer to your
distribution on how to obtain a statically linked set.

Statically linked programs have all the required dependencies compiled in. As
such, they require no external libraries at runtime. This does however
increase the size of the binary.

or where-ever your OS stores the blkid.h file.
